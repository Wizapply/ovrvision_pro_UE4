# OvrvisionProSDK for UE4
==================

These are plug-in and the source codes for using Ovrvision by UE4.
However it has some problems. 
Please avoid the adoption to your project that it is under development.

How to use
==================

1. This was latest tested on 4.10.4

2. Copy the plugins folder to your `<Game>/Plugins/` folder; alternatively, you can copy to the `Engine/Plugins/` if you wish to make the plugin available to all of your projects.
   > Do not forget to run UE4's `Generate Project Files` to account for these changes!
